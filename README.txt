Simulation with MPC:

In the following documents some terrain profiles are created, to change the terrain, comment the one active and uncomment the desired terrain profile to be tested

0) MPC with intial constraints and objective function
  - MPC_bnb_fmincon_0_no_changes.mlx

1) MPC with intial objective function and constraints modifyed
  - MPC_bnb_fmincon_1_constraint_added.mlx

2) MPC with intial constraints and objective function changed
  - MPC_bnb_fmincon_2_obj_func_change

The results of the steps on both modifications and terrains are saved on the Performance.mlx file
